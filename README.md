# BMO-OS

I DO NOT RECCOMEND USING IT BEFORE v1.0.0 WHICH IS COMING OUT SOON

HOW TO USE:
First off, you're gonna need a GPT API-KEY and an ELEVENLABS API-KEY, in this code i removed the keys, insert your own.
To add your CHAT-GPT Key, add a new enviorment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY, set its value to your key.
As for the elevenlabs key, go to BMOOS.py located in Important-Stuff and change the "set_api_key" value (line 15) to your elevenlabs API Key.
