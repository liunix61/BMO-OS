# BMO-OS
My first ever repository, mostly a place to dump my BMO robot code, might make it public

HOW TO USE:
First off, you're gonna need a GPT API-KEY and an ELEVENLABS API-KEY, in this code i removed the keys, insert your own.
To add your CHAT-GPT Key, add a new enviorment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY, set its value to your key.
As for the elevenlabs key, navigate to line (do later) and change the "set_api_key" value to your elevenlabs API Key.
