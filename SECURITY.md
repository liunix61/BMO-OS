# Security Policy

This Project uses API Keys, this code DOES NOT steal your api keys, you can check it top to bottom, its open source my guy.

Once changing the source code to add your keys, make sure to keep it extremely hidden, try not to reveal the location of it even to friends, make sure to monitor your openai key activity if you think something suspicious is going on.

## Versions and their security

Due to the nature of this code, i cant really add security measures, feel free to requests features if you can brainstorm better than me

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| __any__   |           :x: |
